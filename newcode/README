The new code is made up of three parts:
1 FileDivider,
	divide the huge data set into small blocks, each block could be converted to tetrahedron individually.
	output: filename.ind.n, filename.pos.n, filename.vel.n

2 TetraSlicer,
	slice the the dataset into triangle slices
	output: filename.tri.pos.n filename.tri.vel.n

3 Render
	render the tetra slicer files into density blocks
	output: filename.dens filename.velx filename.vely filename.velz
