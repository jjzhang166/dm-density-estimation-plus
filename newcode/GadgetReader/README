==GadgetReader==

This is GadgetReader, a library for easily reading Gadget format files. 

To build the library, do:

make

For the test suite (requires Boost::Test > 1.34), do: 

make test

For the doxygen-generated documentation:

make doc

For the bindings (requires swig > 1.30): 

make bind

To delete compiler output:

make clean or make cleanall

To build example program:

make PGIIhead

Note this embeds the current path of the library into the executable, so you will have a 
linker error if you then move librgad.so to another directory. 

Further documentation may be found in the doxygen generated files in doc/html/index.html
(type "make doc" to make this file) or in gadgetreader.hpp
