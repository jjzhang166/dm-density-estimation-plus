 * Framework will be:
 * tetrahedron.h  			-- the tetrahedron structure
 * tetrastream.h			-- a stream that provides the tetrahedrons
 * grids.h					-- a scheme that defines the grids, provides sub-interface to the part of
 * 								grids structure. For example: change some portion of it. If the structure
 * 								is too large, then only the required portion is loaded, others are saved
 * 								in file. After commit, the current on-RAM portion will be also saved to
 * 								the memory.
 * estimator.h				-- takes TetraStream and GridManager as input, calculate the grids value
